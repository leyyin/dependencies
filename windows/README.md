This zip file contains all necessary dependencies to compile
SuperTuxKart with Visual Studio 12 or later (including the free
express version).

Unzip these files into the SuperTuxKart code directory (so that
the directory 'dependencies' is next to src and data).
This zip file also includes the necessary .dll files which
are then stored in the root directory, so that they will be
found when starting SuperTuxKart from VS.
